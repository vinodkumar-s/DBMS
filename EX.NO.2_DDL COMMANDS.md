# EXP NO 2: DATA DEFINITION LANGUGE COMMANDS 
### DATE
## AIM:
To create a student database and execute DDL queries using SQL.


## THEORY
### DDL (Data Definition Language)

* DDL or Data Definition Language actually consists of the SQL commands that can be used to define the database schema.
* It simply deals with descriptions of the database schema and is used to create and modify the structure of database objects in the database.
* DDL is a set of SQL commands used to create, modify, and delete database structures but not data.
* These commands are normally not used by a general user, who should be accessing the database via an application.

 
### List of DDL commands: 
1. CREATE: This command is used to create the database or its objects (like table, index, function, views, store procedure, and triggers).
2. DROP: This command is used to delete objects from the database.
3. ALTER: This is used to alter the structure of the database.
4. TRUNCATE: This is used to remove all records from a table, including all spaces allocated for the records are removed.
5. RENAME: This is used to rename an object existing in the database.

## Query:
### 1) Create a database studentdb

```
### OUTPUT:

### 2) Create a table student with the following fieds RegisterNumber,Name,Age,Address,Phone number
### SQL QUERY: 
```sql
create table student(Regno int,Name varchar(20),Age int,Address varchar(50),Phonenumber varchar(10));
```
### OUTPUT:
![2](https://github.com/Reebak04/DBMS/assets/118364993/a5a4a3d5-2f02-4c59-8b01-42d1fb8aa565)

### 3) Alter the above student table by adding another attribute department
### SQL QUERY: 
```sql
alter table student
add dept varchar(20);
```
### OUTPUT:
![3](https://github.com/Reebak04/DBMS/assets/118364993/95ed4b16-5903-4326-96d0-b4ace6ca3a1b)

### 4) Drop the student table
### SQL QUERY:
```sql 
drop table student;
```
### OUTPUT:
![4](https://github.com/Reebak04/DBMS/assets/118364993/b32eeddc-b5ff-4f94-918e-931cd0bcf761)

### 5) Delete the student table using truncate keyword
### SQL QUERY: 
```sql 
truncate table student;
```
### OUTPUT:
![5](https://github.com/Reebak04/DBMS/assets/118364993/8b5081e3-2a6b-469f-8372-2e610279df4c)

### 6) Rename the student table to mystudent
### SQL QUERY: 
``` sql
alter table student
rename to mystudent;
```

### OUTPUT:
![6](https://github.com/Reebak04/DBMS/assets/118364993/ba6203d6-1507-44ca-a3c2-de7e46d3c328)

## Result:
         Thus the basic DDL commands in SQL are executed.
